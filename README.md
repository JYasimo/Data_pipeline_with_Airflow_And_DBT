# Introduction
Airbnb is an online-based marketing company that connects people looking for accommodation (Airbnb guests) to people looking to rent their properties (Airbnb hosts) on a short-term or long-term basis. The rental properties include apartments (dominant), homes, boats, and a whole lot more. As of 2019, there are 150 million users of Airbnb services in 191 countries, making it a major disruptor of the traditional hospitality industry (this is akin to how Uber and other emerging transportation services have disrupted the traditional intra-city transportation services). As a rental ecosystem, Airbnb generates tons of data including but not limited to: density of rentals across regions (cities and neighborhoods), price variations across rentals, host-guest interactions in the form of reviews, and so forth.
We will focus on Sydney for this assignment, and the dataset used is from May 2020 to April 2021.

# Role
The goal of this project is to build production-ready data pipelines with Airflow. We worked with two input datasets that needed to be processed and cleaned before loading this insightful information separately into a data warehouse (using ELT pipelines) and a data mart for analytical purposes.
